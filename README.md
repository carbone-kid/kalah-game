# This is a simple implementation of Kalah game 

It's made as a Spring Boot application using Spring MVC on the backend and AngularJS on the frontend.

It's wrapped to the Docker container, deployed to the cloud hosting and available here http://82.196.0.94/

The Docker container is available at https://hub.docker.com/ as sfirsov/kalah-game

As the game is multiplayer you first need to login with unique name.

Then you need to create a game...

... and waiting for the opponent.

Or join an existing game.

And finally play the game.

There is a timeout for user inactivity. If the user inactive for some time he will be removed. So if the game stopped working after some time AFK - this is a feature, not a bug :)
