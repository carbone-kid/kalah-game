# This is a simple implementation of Kalah game 

It's made as a Spring Boot application using Spring MVC on the backend and AngularJS on the frontend.

It's wrapped to the Docker container, deployed to the cloud hosting and available here http://188.226.169.79:8081/

The Docker container is available at https://hub.docker.com/ as sfirsov/kalah-game

As the game is multiplayer you first need to register with unique name or enter with the existing credentials.
